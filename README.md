# REACT ROUTER CHALLENGE

<p> In this challenge, you are going to refactor an application to use React Routing. The Routing NPM is already set up once you use NPM Install. You also already have a Nav component
set up with style, which will show on each page of the application. I have also included your other two components: About and Shop. Right now, the app renders everything on the same page.</p>

<p> Your goal is to refactor this to only load each page when the route is set up to do so.</p>

<p> Your first step should be to set up React Router to go to each page (an example would be that when the URL has "/about" behind it, it will render the About component). You might also see that the home component within the App.js. This component needs to render when the URL has just a "/" behind it or it's just the normal URL. A hint to keep in mind is that a / is used in all of our URL paths, so we need to be exact in what the "/" path routes to.</p>

<p> If you made it this far, then you understand routing. We are not done yet though. We need to link our list items in the Nav component to their proper component. To give you a hint, you need to import Link from React Router Dom and wrap each of your list items inside of Link, just make sure you are linking to the proper page route.</p>

<p> That's it! If you have any trouble, check out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Law7wfdg_ls&t=1679s which is what this challenge is based on, or look in the Answer folder to see what the files will look like when done.</p>
